# 🚀 Tetis v9.1: Computational Scalability Package

This repository contains the full package of files and scripts used to analyze and predict the computational performance and scalability of the distributed hydrological model, **TETIS v9.1**.

The primary goal is to provide a predictive tool for estimating execution times based on input configurations and specific hardware.

## 📦 Repository Structure

| Directory | Content | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Modelos`** | Compressed archives (.7z) | Contains **30 compressed basin configurations** with all necessary TETIS input files, parameter maps, and executables (`Tetis.exe`, `Hantec.exe`). |
| **`Monitor`** | Hardware tools | Contains the HWiNFO64 utility and configuration files (`equipo.csv`, `monitoreo.csv`) used to collect hardware data (CPU, RAM, Clock Speed). |
| **`Codes`** | Python Scripts | Contains the trained **Random Forest (RF)** models and Python scripts (`.py`) for predicting execution times. |
| **`Res`** | Output Folder | Destination folder for saving the prediction results and performance plots generated by the Python scripts. |

## 🛠️ Performance Prediction and Model Usage

To analyze or predict TETIS execution times using the stored Random Forest models, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Prepare the Data and Hardware Information

This step gathers the necessary hardware data (`equipo.csv` and `monitoreo.csv`) which serves as input for the prediction models.

1.  **Download and Uncompress:** Download and decompress all `.7z` archives located in the **`Modelos`** directory.
2.  **Collect Static Hardware Data (`equipo.csv`):**
      * Navigate to the **`Monitor`** folder.
      * Execute **`HWiNFO64.exe`** in **full configuration mode**.
      * Ensure the output file **`equipo.csv`** is generated. This file will contain static hardware specifications (RAM, core count, processor model, etc.).
3.  **Collect Dynamic Hardware Data (`monitoreo.csv`):**
      * Execute **`HWiNFO64.exe`** in **sensors-only mode** (or a similar lightweight mode).
      * Ensure the output file **`monitoreo.csv`** is generated. This file will store the average processor clock speeds measured during monitoring.

### Step 2: Run the Prediction Script

Navigate to the **`Codes`** directory and execute the relevant Python script based on the process you wish to analyze.

1.  **Choose the Script:**
      * To predict the performance of **`Topolco.sds`** generation and **`Hantec.sds`** execution (pre-processes), run:
        ```bash
        python Rend_Topolco_Hantec.py
        ```
      * To predict the performance of the **Hydrological Simulation Execution**, run:
        ```bash
        python 03_Rend_Tetis.py
        ```
2.  **Configuration:** **Review and modify the file paths** within the selected script (`.py`) if your local directory structure differs from the original.
3.  **Output:** The results of the execution (prediction times, error analysis, and charts) will be saved in the **`Res`** output folder.
