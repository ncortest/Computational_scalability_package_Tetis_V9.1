🚀 Rendimientos_Tetis: Computational Scalability AnalysisThis repository contains the full package of files and scripts used to analyze and predict the computational performance and scalability of the TETIS v9.1 distributed hydrological model.The primary goal is to provide a predictive tool for estimating execution times based on input configurations and specific hardware.📦 Repository StructureDirectoryContentDescriptionModelosCompressed archives (.7z)Contains 30 compressed basin configurations with all necessary TETIS input files, parameter maps, and executables (Tetis.exe, Hantec.exe).MonitorHardware toolsContains the HWiNFO64 utility and configuration files (equipo.csv, monitoreo.csv) used to collect hardware data (CPU, RAM, Clock Speed).CodesPython ScriptsContains the trained Random Forest (RF) models and Python scripts (.py) for predicting execution times.ResOutput FolderDestination folder for saving the prediction results and performance plots generated by the Python scripts.🛠️ Performance Prediction and Model UsageTo analyze or predict TETIS execution times using the stored Random Forest models, follow these steps:Step 1: Prepare the Data and Hardware InformationThis step gathers the necessary hardware data (equipo.csv and monitoreo.csv) which serves as input for the prediction models.Download and Uncompress: Download and decompress all .7z archives located in the Modelos directory.Collect Static Hardware Data (equipo.csv):Navigate to the Monitor folder.Execute HWiNFO64.exe in full configuration mode.Ensure the output file equipo.csv is generated. This file will contain static hardware specifications (RAM, core count, processor model, etc.).Collect Dynamic Hardware Data (monitoreo.csv):Execute HWiNFO64.exe in sensors-only mode (or a similar lightweight mode).Ensure the output file monitoreo.csv is generated. This file will store the average processor clock speeds measured during monitoring.Step 2: Run the Prediction ScriptNavigate to the Codes directory and execute the relevant Python script based on the process you wish to analyze.Choose the Script:To predict the performance of Topolco.sds generation and Hantec.sds execution (pre-processes), run:Bashpython Rend_Topolco_Hantec.py
To predict the performance of the Hydrological Simulation Execution, run:Bashpython 03_Rend_Tetis.py
Configuration: Review and modify the file paths within the selected script (.py) if your local directory structure differs from the original.Output: The results of the execution (prediction times, error analysis, and charts) will be saved in the Res output folder.🔗 CitationPlease cite the associated publication when using this repository or the derived models:[Insert Full Article Title Here]DOI: [Insert Article DOI Here]
